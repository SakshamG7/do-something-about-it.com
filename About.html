      <h2>A Message to All: Share This Website and Raise Awareness!</h2>
      <p>
        This website was originally created by me, Saksham Goel, in Grade 8
        (Updated content and citations in 2022) as part of a school project
        focused on environmental issues. I chose to address e-waste and climate
        change because of my passion for technology and my commitment to
        recycling and reusing devices. Climate change is a serious global
        problem, and these two topics are deeply interconnected.
        <br /><br />
        In keeping with the theme of sustainability, this website is hosted on
        recycled hardware. The server is an old Raspberry Pi that was collecting
        dust, and the device hosting the website is a broken laptop I saved from
        being discarded. Together, they demonstrate the potential of reusing
        technology to make a positive impact.
        <br /><br />
        For more about my current work, you can visit my business website:
        <a href="https://www.aceiq.ca" target="_blank">AceIQ</a>, where I help
        businesses transition to the digital world. <br /><br />
        This website is a verified and official source of information, created
        to raise awareness about climate change and e-waste.
