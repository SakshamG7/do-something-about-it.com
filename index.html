            <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
            <p>
              Climate change refers to changes in temperature and weather
              patterns. These changes may be natural, such as through the
              variations in the solar cycle. Ever since the 1800s, Human
              activities such as burning fossil fuels generate greenhouse
              emissions that trap the sun’s heat and raise temperatures.

            <h2>People are Experiencing Climate Change in Different Ways</h2>
            <p>
              Temperatures are rising due to greenhouse gasses which trap more
              heat in the atmosphere. Droughts are becoming more extreme around
              the world.Tropical storms becoming more severe due to warmer ocean
              water temperatures. As the temperatures rise, there is less
              snowpack in mountain ranges and the snow melts faster which
              results in glaciers melting at a faster rate.This causes the sea
              levels to rise which threatens the marine ecosystems.

              The Earth's average temperature has increased about 2 degrees
              Fahrenheit .
            </li>
            <li>
              Summer temperatures are projected to continue rising, and a
              reduction of soil moisture, which exacerbates heat waves. The
              intensity, frequency and duration of hurricanes, as well as the
              frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all
              increased.
            </li>
            <li>
              Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches. It is projected to
              rise another 1 to 8 feet by 2100. This is the result of added
              water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it
              warms.

              The Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice free in

            <h2>Attempts to Solve E-Waste</h2>
            <p>
              E-waste is a major problem, as only 12% of tech that is thrown out
              is recycled. This is bad for the environment as tech has a lot of
              heavy metals and it also has rare materials like silver, gold,
              etc. Here are some attempts to solve this problem.
              <br /><br />
              There can be a reward system for people that donate and/or recycle
              tech, meaning that people get a small sum for donating/recycling
              the e-waste. Apple is already doing this, as seen here: Apple
              Trade-In, Canada. Doing this can be more profitable for companies
              as they salvage the materials used on the hardware and use it for
              newer technologies and people can get some money to buy something
              new than throwing the technology in the trash can.
              <br /><br />
              A simple solution can be to put a fine if someone throws out
              hardware instead of recycling it. Doing this can help prevent
              people from throwing out valuable materials instead of wasting
              them. But there can be cases where people don't get caught not
              recycling and they wouldn't have to bother with the fine.
              <br /><br />
              Another solution can be to repurpose the old tech if it can still
              be used. If the hardware cannot be repurposed or it is damaged,
              try to find working parts inside and if all the parts do not work,
              then please try remembering to recycle rather than throwing it
              out.

            <h2>Connection between Climate change and E-waste</h2>
            <p>
              It is also worth considering the effects electronic goods have on
              climate change. Every device ever produced has a carbon footprint
              and is contributing to global warming. Did you know that the
              manufacture of a tonne of laptops results in potentially 10 tonnes
              of CO2 being emitted. When the carbon dioxide released over a
              device’s lifetime is predominantly released during production,
              before consumers buy a product. This is the key determinant of
              overall environmental impact. <br /><br />
