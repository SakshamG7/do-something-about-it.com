              <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
              <p>
                Climate change refers to changes in temperature and weather
                patterns. These changes may be natural, such as through the
                variations in the solar cycle. Ever since the 1800s, Human
                activities such as burning fossil fuels generate greenhouse
                emissions that trap the sun’s heat and raise temperatures.

              <h2>People are Experiencing Climate Change in Different Ways</h2>
              <p>
                Temperatures are rising due to greenhouse gasses which trap more
                heat in the atmosphere. Droughts are becoming more extreme
                around the world.Tropical storms becoming more severe due to
                warmer ocean water temperatures. As the temperatures rise, there
                is less snowpack in mountain ranges and the snow melts faster
                which results in glaciers melting at a faster rate.This causes
                the sea levels to rise which threatens the marine ecosystems.

                The Earth's average temperature has increased about 2 degrees
                Fahrenheit .
              </li>
              <li>
                Summer temperatures are projected to continue rising, and a
                reduction of soil moisture, which exacerbates heat waves. The
                intensity, frequency and duration of hurricanes, as well as the
                frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have
                all increased.
              </li>
              <li>
                Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches. It is projected to
                rise another 1 to 8 feet by 2100. This is the result of added
                water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it
                warms.

              <h2>Attempts to Solve E-Waste</h2>
              <p>
                E-waste is a major problem, as only 12% of tech that is thrown
                out is recycled. This is bad for the environment as tech has a
                lot of heavy metals and it also has rare materials like silver,
                gold, etc. Here are some attempts to solve this problem.
                <br /><br />
                There can be a reward system for people that donate and/or
                recycle tech, meaning that people get a small sum for
                donating/recycling the e-waste. Apple is already doing this, as
                seen here: Apple Trade-In, Canada. Doing this can be more
                profitable for companies as they salvage the materials used on
                the hardware and use it for newer technologies and people can
                get some money to buy something new than throwing the technology
                in the trash can.
                <br /><br />
                A simple solution can be to put a fine if someone throws out
                hardware instead of recycling it. Doing this can help prevent
                people from throwing out valuable materials instead of wasting
                them. But there can be cases where people don't get caught not
                recycling and they wouldn't have to bother with the fine.
                <br /><br />
                Another solution can be to repurpose the old tech if it can
                still be used. If the hardware cannot be repurposed or it is
                damaged, try to find working parts inside and if all the parts
                do not work, then please try remembering to recycle rather than
                throwing it out.

              <h2>Connection between Climate change and E-waste</h2>
              <p>
                It is also worth considering the effects electronic goods have
                on climate change. Every device ever produced has a carbon
                footprint and is contributing to global warming. Did you know
                that the manufacture of a tonne of laptops results in
                potentially 10 tonnes of CO2 being emitted. When the carbon
                dioxide released over a device’s lifetime is predominantly
                released during production, before consumers buy a product. This
                is the key determinant of overall environmental impact.
                <br /><br />
                We have to recognise that we all can make a big difference in
                both e-waste reduction and preventing climate change.
